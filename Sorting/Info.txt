Bubble Sort
===========
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that 
repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and 
swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 

The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. 
The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when 
compared to insertion sort.
 
It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some 
out-of-order elements nearly in position.

Heap Sort
==========
Heap is a special tree-based data structure. A binary tree is said to follow a heap data structure if

1.It is a complete binary tree
2.All nodes in the tree follow the property that they are greater than their children i.e.the largest element is 
  at the root and both its children and smaller than the root and so on.Such a heap is called a max-heap.If instead 
  all nodes are smaller than their children, it is called a min-heap

Given an array

1.Arrange the numbers in Binary tree
2.For Max-HEAP start by heapifying the lowest smallest trees and gradually move up until we reach the root element.
3.When tree satisfies Max-Heap property, then the largest item is stored at the root node.
4.Remove the root element and put at the end of the array (nth position) 
5.Put the last item of the tree (heap) at the vacant place.
6.Reduce the size of the heap by 1 and heapify the root element again so that we have highest element at root.
The process is repeated until all the items of the list is sorted.
